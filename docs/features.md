Sorry, we are still working on completing the initial features.  If you
would be interested in helping, feel free to chime in on an existing
issue or create a new issue to start a discussion about how/where you
can help.

## <a name="future"></a> Future Features

TBD, but here is some thinking.  More exploration is needed about what
open source components exist that we can leverage.

* JavaScript library for validating an object using your schema
* Node.js development server for defining your schema (saved as text file)
* Node.js production server for hosting REST APIs and UIs based on your schema.
* AngularJS UI for editing objects of a given schema.
